##### Multimajor Objectives

Members have been clamoring for Navigate to gracefully support students having multiple objectives.  For example, students might double-major or have a major and a minor.  We currently don't do that.

##### What we have done

* Model Design
* Import Pipeline Build
* Rebuild of the AP page using REST

##### The Big Organizing Idea

Schools want students to have goals they can be working for, and we want to make templates for those.

But those goals might be in groups (goalsets) and vary by school.

So we need to give students 1+ goalsets, and those goalsets 1+ goals.

##### But How Do We Get There?

So how do we populate those tables?

We have a bunch of MM.*Feed tables that DIS gives us, and we have a transformation pipeline.
